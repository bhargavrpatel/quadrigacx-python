# QuadrigaCX
An unofficial library for the [QuadrigaCX V2 API](https://www.quadrigacx.com/api_info)

## Features
* Supports Public and Private function

`quadrigacx` is available on PYPI. Install with `pip`:

Note that while I have tried my best to support both Python 2.7 as well as Python 3, I would appreciate some contributions to test specific versions.
